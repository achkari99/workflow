ROLE & MINDSET
You are a world-class product designer + creative front-end engineer.
You are NOT building a generic SaaS dashboard.
You are designing a bold, opinionated, energetic product interface that feels like a MISSION, a QUEST, a JOURNEY.

This app is used EVERY DAY.
If it feels boring, neutral, or corporate, it has FAILED.

Your job is to create a UI that feels:
- alive
- bold
- confident
- motivating
- slightly gamified
- visually striking
while still being usable and structured.

Think LESS “dashboard”.
Think MORE “control room”, “active quest”, “mission in progress”.

PRODUCT CONTEXT
The product is called **Living Workflow**.

It is a guided workflow system with strict steps, but the structure should feel invisible.
Users should feel like they are PLAYING a serious game of building real things.

This is a personal tool first, SaaS later.
Taste matters more than completeness.

---

CRITICAL DESIGN REFERENCE (IMPORTANT)
Take inspiration from bold products like:
- NeoLearn (bold typography, contrast, identity)
- Game-like progression systems
- Mission / quest interfaces

DO NOT copy layouts.
DO copy ENERGY, CONFIDENCE, and PRESENCE.

WHAT TO BUILD (VERY SPECIFIC)

### 1️⃣ REMOVE THE TRADITIONAL DASHBOARD
Do NOT create:
- “Dashboard”
- “Overview of workflows”
- Generic cards in a grid

Those are banned.

---

### 2️⃣ BUILD A **HOME / MISSION SCREEN**
This is the first screen users see.

It must include:

#### 🔥 A BOLD HERO STATEMENT (TOP-LEFT OR CENTER)
Examples (choose one or create a better one):
- “MOVE THE WORK FORWARD.”
- “BUILD. VALIDATE. SHIP.”
- “ONE STEP CLOSER.”

This should be BIG typography.
This is the emotional anchor.

---

#### 🎯 ACTIVE QUEST (MAIN CENTERPIECE)
Instead of a list, show ONE main thing:

**Active Quest Card**
- Workflow name
- Current step (e.g. “Step 3 — Lock the Scope”)
- Visual progress indicator (8 dots, path, or bar)
- Big CTA:
  → “Continue the mission →”

This card should feel IMPORTANT.
Larger than anything else.
Visually dominant.

---

#### ⚡ MOMENTUM SIGNALS (SMALL BUT POWERFUL)
Add subtle game-like signals:
- “🔥 3-day build streak”
- “⚡ Waiting on client”
- “🏁 3 steps to delivery”

These should feel motivating, not childish.

---

#### 🧩 SECONDARY WORK (QUIET)
Other workflows can exist, but:
- smaller
- less contrast
- secondary placement

They must NOT compete with the Active Quest.

---

### 3️⃣ VISUAL STYLE RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- Strong contrast zones (light + dark areas)
- Bold typography hierarchy
- Asymmetry (avoid perfect grids)
- Floating elements / overlapping layers
- No “safe SaaS” look

Color:
- High contrast base (white / near-white + dark accents)
- ONE strong accent color (electric blue, neon green, or coral)
- Use accent sparingly but confidently

---

### 4️⃣ LANGUAGE & COPY (VERY IMPORTANT)

Ban corporate language.

DO NOT use:
- “Dashboard”
- “Overview”
- “Submit”
- “Task completed”

Use language like:
- “Continue the mission”
- “Quest complete”
- “Next move”
- “Locked in”
- “In progress”

The app should feel like it TALKS to you.

---

### 5️⃣ MOTION & LIFE
Add:
- entrance animations
- subtle hover motion
- satisfying transitions

Motion should add ENERGY, not decoration.

---

### 6️⃣ TECH CONSTRAINTS
- React
- Tailwind
- No generic UI kits
- Mock data is fine
- Focus ONLY on:
  - Home / Mission screen
  - Visual identity
  - Layout
  - Typography
  - Interaction feel

---

SUCCESS CRITERIA
When finished, the UI should make the user think:
“This feels bold.”
“This feels different.”
“I want to click continue.”

If it feels like a normal SaaS app, you FAILED.

---

DELIVERABLE
A visually striking Home / Mission screen that replaces the dashboard entirely and establishes the identity of Living Workflow.

DO NOT IMPLEMENT FULL WORKFLOW LOGIC YET.
DESIGN COMES FIRST.
